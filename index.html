   <h3><pre><font color="green">    During this week of study, I learned the basics of html.
         This is very interesting to me. A website can be gradually created from an empty folder. 
          And I think it was very interesting and important for me to gain this knowledge. 
           As an artist I have always wanted to have a website where I could show and save my works.
           This course gave me such an opportunity. Give me the ability to create a website of my own. 
            As the same time, it is also important for my future, it is a really useful skills for me to look for a job. </font></pre></h3>

            <h4><pre><font color="red">                       This semester has been very stressful for me, as the issue of changing degrees resulted in me needing an extra academic year to complete my undergraduate program.
                          Moreover, postgraduate application matters are also concentrated in the brow palace. There is also the pressure of family and preparing to start some small businesses during school,
                           which makes me feel a little breathless. But I think I should be able to handle this. I need to study harder in class and complete my homework more seriously.
                            So I quit my my all my classmates. Hopefully I can successfully maintain my GPA and find an ideal institution to complete my master's degree.  </font></pre></h4>
